Class 197: fixing errors

60% of time coding
40% of time fixing errors

-> Two type of errors:

◦syntax errors
◦exceptions

first it checks the syntax, so you need to fix this first.
then it checks the logic of the program

try-except block does not catch syntax errors


Class 198: Command Lines

CMD commands

◦pwd -> print working directory
◦mkdir dir_name
◦touch filename -> create a file

◦rm filename or rm -r directory_name -> remove either a ◦directory or a file

◦mv file30.txt data/file.30txt -> move a file into another directory, also helps to rename a file

◦cp file3.py data/file3.py -> this one just copies it

◦nano file3.py -> open a text editor in the terminal
◦cat file3.py -> opens the file and shows you what's inside
